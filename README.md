# Chrome Remote Protocol Request Interception Test
This repo serves only as a standalone demonstration of how to capture a request. As of writing, this is currently not working.

Created to share with the Chrome team to gain an understanding of if I'm either doing it wrong, or if theres a bug.

Tested on Mac, Chrome stable and Canary.

### Running this example
* **Install dependencies** `yarn install`
* **Run** `node index.js`
