# Chrome Remote Protocol Request Interception Test
This repo serves only as a standalone demonstration of how to capture a request. As of writing, this is [currently not working](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/chrome-debugging-protocol/MaIbpNPWqgI/56G3ep-aAwA).

Created to share with the Chrome team to gain an understanding of if I'm either doing it wrong, or if theres a bug.

Tested on Mac, Chrome stable and Canary.

### Running this example
* **Install dependencies** `yarn install`
* **Run** `node index.js`

Then, uncomment the `--headless` flag line and try again.
